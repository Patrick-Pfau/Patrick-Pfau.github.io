## Explanation of Different Print Modes

The printer offers several print modes optimized for different materials and quality levels.  
For example, the “Standard Mode” balances speed and detail, while “High Quality” mode takes longer but produces finer prints.  
Some modes adjust temperature and layer height automatically to suit PLA or ABS filament.

## Expert Mode with G-code

For advanced users, the Sculpto+ supports an Expert Mode allowing G-code customization.  
This lets you fine-tune print parameters beyond what the app offers.  
Understanding basic G-code commands can help you optimize print quality, speed, and material usage.  
Be cautious though, as incorrect commands might cause print failures.

## Hardware and Printing Configurations & Improvements

You can enhance your printer by upgrading components like the print bed or nozzle.  
Calibration is essential for accurate prints — make sure the bed is level and the extruder is clean.  
Additional cooling fans or improved filament holders can also improve print results.
